# Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner

# Challenge 4
# Hereâ€™s a bigger challenge. Write the pseudocode for a program
# where the player and the computer trade places in the number
# guessing game. That is, the player picks a random number
# between 1 and 100 that the computer has to guess. Before you
# start, think about how you guess. If all goes well, try coding the game.
